Custom Extensions Versions Compatible with PnET-Succession v5.1
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following extensions have been specifically compiled to work with PnET-Succession v5.1.  However, they were also designed to be able to coexist with extension versions that are compatible with other succession extensions.  Therefore, most of these custom extenions installs with the version number as part of the official extension name, which must be included when calling the extension in the scenario file.  See the details below for the official extension name for each.

** Biomass Browse **
Version: 2.1-b2
Official extension name:  "Biomass Browse v2.1"
This version is the same as the forthcoming Biomass Browse v2.0, with one notable exception.  In v2.1, the succession extension provides the cohort ANPP values rather than being internally estimated from cohort biomass by the Browse extension.  This change allows ANPP to be more dynamic as cohort annual growth varies in response to conditions.
